This is my first attempt at creating a website in golang, I plan to develop this site to showcase my skills. 
I there fore chose to build the sit eusing GO as I have never used Go to build webapps before.

Within the site I plan on incoroprating several languages and showcaseoff more skills such as html and css/scss 

Currently the site is being prepared for heroku/netifly how ever if you clone the reop and run `./SimpleWebApp.exe` in the terminal when in the root folder you will be able to view the site in its current state by going to `Localhost:8080`. 

For most recent developments see 'portfolio' branch.
