This is my first attempt at creating a website in golang, I plan to develop this site to showcase my skills. 
I there fore chose to build the sit eusing GO as I have never used Go to build webapps before.

Within the site I plan on incoroprating several languages and showcaseoff more skills such as html and css/scss 

Currently the site is being hosted on heroku `https://l33t-portfolio.herokuapp.com/`

Fgit push mastereel free to clone the repo however Go will be required

For most recent developments see 'portfolio' branch.
